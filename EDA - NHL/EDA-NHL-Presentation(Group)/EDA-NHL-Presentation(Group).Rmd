# Describing Data

- Our data has 34 columns with 7721 observations
- All observations are from the NHL Stanley Cup 2022 playoffs
  - Not inclusive of the Stanley Cup Finals

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
playoff_shot_data <- read_csv("nhl_playoffs_shots_2022.csv")
playoff_shot_data[1:6, ]%>%
  rename(shooterHand = shooterLeftRight, xcord = arenaAdjustedXCord, ycord = arenaAdjustedYCord)%>%
  select(shooterName, team, shooterHand, event, shotType, shotDistance, teamCode, time, xcord, ycord)%>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html')
```

# Limitations

- Each team played a different number of games
  - For example, Nashville only played 4 games whereas Colorado played 14 games

- We were not given player positions in the data set

- The sample size is small compared to a regular NHL season

- Could not perform in depth player analysis due to only having shot data available 

---

# Background Information

####**What we're doing**

--

- Looking at the NHL 2022 playoff data we are presented with a series of questions we wanted to look into more in depth

--

####**How this can be useful?**

--

- We can try to see if there are player and/or team shooting trends. Examining different aspects of the shot attempts will allow us to see this.

# Question 1 

--

### Is there a difference between left handed vs. right handed player shots?

---

### **Difference in Shot Location Between Left and Right Handed Shooters**
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width= 9, fig.height= 4.9}
playoff_shot_data$shooterLeftRight <- factor(playoff_shot_data$shooterLeftRight, 
                                             labels = c("Left Handed Shooter", "Right Handed Shooter"))
library(sportyR)
playoff_shot_data$shooterLeftRight <- factor(playoff_shot_data$shooterLeftRight, labels = c("Left Handed Shooter", "Right Handed Shooter"))
nhl_shots_filter <- playoff_shot_data %>% filter(arenaAdjustedYCord < 41, arenaAdjustedYCord > -41) %>% mutate(absXCoord = -abs(arenaAdjustedXCord))
geom_hockey(league = "NHL", full_surf = F) + 
  stat_density2d(data = nhl_shots_filter,
                 adjust = 0.5,
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 h = 10,
                 aes(x = absXCoord,
                     y = arenaAdjustedYCord,
                     fill = after_stat(level)),
                 geom = "polygon") +

  labs(#title = "Differences in Position on the Ice Both Handed Players Shoot",
       caption = "Data Courtesy of MoneyPuck.com") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

class: inverse center middle

# Question 2 

--

### Is there a relationship between shot type and the distance of the shot?

---
#### **How Type of Shot Varies by Distance**
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width= 9, fig.height= 4.9}
playoff_shot_data$shotType <- factor(playoff_shot_data$shotType, labels = c("Backhand", "Deflection", "Slapshot", "Snapshot", "Tip", "Wrap", "Wrist"))
mx <- mean(playoff_shot_data$shotDistance)
playoff_shot_data%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = shotDistance))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, 
                 color = "cornflowerblue", 
                 fill = "cornflowerblue",
                 alpha = .22, 
                 size = .65) +
  geom_vline(xintercept= mx,linetype="88", color = "darkred") +
  labs(#title = "How Type of Shot Varies by Distance",
       x = "Distance Away from Goal (in feet)",
       y = "Frequency of Type of Shot",
       caption = "Data Courtesy of Moneypuck.com") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ shotType, ncol = 2)
```

# Question 3

--

### Is there a significant difference in player and team output depending on if they are the home or away team? AKA: Is home team advantage real?

### **Density Curves for Goals and Shots for Home and Away Teams**
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width= 9, fig.height= 4.7}

# Major Takeaways / Future Things to Examine

- It appears that left handed shooters have a higher percentage of shots closer to their attacking goal

--

- We can see that shot type varies by the distance away attacking goal
  - Teams could use this information to set up an ideal tactical defense

--

- We can see how some players perform at different levels, dependent on their game location
  - Should Karill Kaprizov be considered the best player in terms of generating offense for himself?

--

- We can see some distinct patterns between home and away teams of how they perform

**Remember take these results with some caution. The number of games varied per team and the sample size is still quite small**
